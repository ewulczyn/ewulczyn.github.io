    "# AB Testing and the Importance of Independent Observations\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical tests commonly used for AB testing, like the two-sample z-test, rely on the assumption that the experimental observations (i.e. samples) are independent. If this assumption is not met, the test becomes unreliable in the sense that it may not achieve the desired false discovery rate. In this post, we will use simulations to explore how violating the assumption of independent observations can impact the reliability of testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many ways observations can be become dependent, a common source of dependence between observations in the online setting is multiple observations stemming from the same user. We will see that pooling observations by user and using user-level aggregates as observations removes this type of dependence and leads to reliable testing, when users act independently of each other. This is not a given and should be carefully considered for each use case, however, a discussion of between-user dependence is outside the scope of this post.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by defining a simple model of users on a website interacting with an AB test. Then we will walk through the necessary code to simulate this model and evaluate whether hypothesis testing gives reliable results. Finally, we will see that a naive approach to testing that does not take into account the dependence between a user's actions leads to high false discovery rates and that the dependence can be removed by taking user-level aggregates."

Think hard about the question \"Is there a way one user's actions can effect another user's actions?\". In our simple banner scenario the answer is likely no. But this can quickly change. For example, if the banners showed a live progress bar of the total number of donations received, then users might change their behavior based on the behavior of others. Another source of between user dependence could arise, if after donating, users where encouraged to brag about their donation on a social network like Facebook or Twitter. Again, a discussion of the myriad was to address between-user dependence is beyond the scope of this post. The main take away is that you need to think carefully about dependence between observations, whenever you are designing a test and that when running tests online, you will almost always need to take user level aggregates."
