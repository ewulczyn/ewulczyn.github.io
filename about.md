Hello! My name is Ellery Wulczyn. I'm originally from Germany but now live in the Bay Area. I studied computer science, statistics and machine learning at Stanford University and am interested in using computational methods to study and enhance (webÂ­-based) social systems. I currently work as a Data Scientist at the Wikimedia Foundation, which is the parent organization of Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.
