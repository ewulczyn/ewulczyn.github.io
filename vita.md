<big><pre>
In collaboration with the Sunlight Foundation and the Harris School of public policy my team built a machine learning sytstem to automatically extract earmarks from congressional texts. ([blog](http://numenta.com))
</pre></big>
Summer 2013
:   **Algorithms Intern**, [Numenta](http://numenta.com)

    Developed a model selection procedure based on clustering that replaced the existing particle swarm optimiation technique and reduced cpu time by a factor of 10k while mainting accuracy. Worked as project lead in two customer engagements in the Advanced Metering Infrastructure industry.
