Experience
----------
09/2014 - Present
:   **Data Scientist**, [The Wikimedia Foundation](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Analytics/Research_and_Data)
<big><pre>
I work in the intersection of behavioral analysis, model building and experimentation. Current projects include a AB testing fundraising banners, a translation recommender system ([app](http://recommend.wmflabs.org/#Recommend)), article censorship and reader segmentation.
</pre></big>
Summer 2014
:   **Data Science for Social Good Fellow**, [DSSG, University of Chicago](http://dssg.io)
<big><pre>
In collaboration with the Sunlight Foundation and the Harris School of public policy my team built a machine learning system to automatically extract earmarks from congressional texts. ([blog](http://numenta.com))
</pre></big>
Summer 2013
:   **Algorithms Intern**, [Numenta](http://numenta.com)

    Developed a model selection procedure based on clustering that replaced the existing particle swarm optimization technique and reduced cpu time by a factor of 10k while maintaining accuracy. Worked as project lead in two customer engagements in the Advanced Metering Infrastructure industry.

Summer 2012
:   **Algorithms Intern**, [Numenta](http://numenta.com)

    Designed an ensemble method for the Cortical Learning Algorithm used at Numenta, which reduced error on benchmark data sets by 10%-20%

2011-2012
:   **Deep Learning Research Assistant**, Stanford University

    Developed a recursive neural network model for learning vector representations for words and phrases. Applied word vector model to information retrieval and paraphrase detection tasks. In collaboration with Richard Socher and under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Ng.
